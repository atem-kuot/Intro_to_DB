# 🗄️ Intro to Databases – MySQL & Python Integration

This repository provides a practical introduction to relational databases using MySQL, alongside a Python interface to interact with the server. It's part of the ALX Software Engineering backend curriculum and focuses on database creation, manipulation, and querying.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🔹 [`MySQLServer.py`](./MySQLServer.py)
A basic Python script to interact with a MySQL database using the `mysql-connector-python` module. It helps in connecting, querying, and fetching data programmatically.

### 🔹 SQL Scripts

- [`alx_book_store.sql`](./alx_book_store.sql)  
  Creates a sample database (`alx_book_store`) and its schema, including tables like `books`, `customers`, etc.

- [`task_2.sql`](./task_2.sql)  
  Inserts or manipulates data in the database — aligned with the second learning objective.

- [`task_3.sql`](./task_3.sql)  
  Demonstrates `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and possibly sorting/grouping.

- [`task_4.sql`](./task_4.sql)  
  Contains advanced filtering, joins, or subqueries.

- [`task_5.sql`](./task_5.sql)  
  Adds more query logic, potentially involving functions or expressions.

- [`task_6.sql`](./task_6.sql)  
  Final exercise for refining retrievals or relationships in relational data.

## 🧪 Requirements

- MySQL Server (version 8+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+
